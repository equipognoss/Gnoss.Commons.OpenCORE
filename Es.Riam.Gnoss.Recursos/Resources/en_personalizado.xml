      {p}GNOSS is a web site where both semantic web and social web technologies converge. GNOSS, which has been developed by {a href="riam.aspx"}RIAM I+L LAB{/a}, enables to create communities, connect their intelligence and activate robust processes of collective creativity, intelligence and thinking.{/p}
      {p}GNOSS is a semantic space: a semantic web. {b}Semantics{/b} has to do with giving meaning to the contents, but meaning is a social fact. GNOSS enables to give meaning collaborativelly to the contents and {b}to generate information on the information{/b}, which is the only feasible way to develop significant contents for a community.{/p}
      {p}GNOSS es Internet 3.0 in an {b}easy{/b} and {b}efficient{/b}; a necessary space to have a complete and complex {b}virtual presence{/b} (with all its profiles) on the professional Internet of the future. People on GNOSS can introduce themselves and have a complex {b}digital identity{/b}, a kind of "virtual ego" able to contain, present and share, in the way everyone wants, its intellectual heritage, its professional history and its expertise.{/p}
      {p}GNOSS is a social site on the web cemented with links, purposes, projects and interests. People on GNOSS can share, distribute, describe and characterize their resources of knowledge and also create them collaboratively; they can generate vocabularies and thesauruses, as well as use the collective tools of thinking and creation to reach agreements, identify scenarios and share visions. In short, they can all together develop a kind of {b}global mind{/b} or system of {b}ubiquitous intelligence{/b}. A global mind that, based on cooperation, enables to face more successfully the processes of change and innovation which are typical of environments characterized by {b}complexity{/b}, uncertainty and {b}accelerated change{/b}.{/p}
      {p}In short, GNOSS is a {b}digital life{/b} space or an {b}augmented social life{/b} space that allows the users to transcend the limitations  of access to information, the personalities and the knowledge, inherent in presential social life. GNOSS is a network of social networks that allows people to represent and connect all the aspects of their training and professional life.{/p}
      {p}The universe of relations on GNOSS is organized around three main spaces:
      {ul}
      {li}{h4 class="textBox"}GNOSS COMMUNITIES:{/h4} Social site of people connected through interests. It represents the social life of a community or society in the net.{/li}
      {li}{h4 class="textBox"}GNOSS:{/h4} Personal site for the management of identities and of the intelectual heritage.{/li}
      {li}{h4 class="textBox"}GNOSS ORGANIZA:{/h4} Social site of organizations and people making them up. It represents the social life of an organization in the net. It is the solution for the companies in the ENTERPRISE 2.0 frame, system of representation and evolutionary management of the organizations.{/li}

      {a href="http://www.gnoss.com"}GNOSS{/a} is a software platform, created by RIAM Intelearning LAB S.L., to build specialized online social networks with dynamic semantic publishing. GNOSS integrates knowledge management, informal learning and collaborative work in a {a href="http://linkeddata.org/"}Linked Data{/a} environment. Every GNOSS space incorporates semantic facet-based searches and semantic context creation which drastically improves user experience.
      {/p}

      {p}
      GNOSS runs on technologies and standards of the semantic web, which makes it possible to structure and link all kinds of content, among them and with other Open Data (Linked Data), and to reinforce and to amplify the knowledge management processes with facet-based searches and generation of documentary and personal contexts for specific information.
      {/p}

      {p}
      GNOSS provides people, groups and organizations with the necessary tools to create and develop their digital identity, connect their intelligences, create communities based on their interests and motivations, and activate thriving processes of collective creativity, brainpower, debate and thinking.

      Web 2.0 has generated more information than that which we could handle without intelligent collaboration systems. Web 3.0 is a social website where technology and systems cooperate with people in the understanding, recovering and linking of information not only among them but also with their own interests. GNOSS is web 3.0, a web expanded thanks to intelligent systems that work with
      {strong}structured and {a href="http://linkeddata.org/"}Linked Data{/a} within the framework of the Semantic Web standards.{/strong}
      {/p}
      {p}
      Linked Data is a practice that seeks documents to express the data they contain in a way that makes them “comprenhensible” to the systems; it involves a way to publish content on the Web that promotes its reuse, maximizing the actual and potential data connectivity turning it affordable for the 'network effect' and informal collaboration in adding value to data, and most important, makes machines 'talk' and 'think' as humans, which enlarges human capacities to discover,  find and get across information.
      {/p}
      {p}
      GNOSS data are linkable among themselves and with any other solutions that work on the Semantic Web through Web services. GNOSS data can be opened to  {strong}interoperate with other applications{/strong} (Data Interoperability), or can be {strong}easily transferred to other solutions{/strong} (Data Portability). This is how GNOSS participates in the construction of the Semantic Web, a web of structured, enriched and Linked Data.

      The social framework of knowledge and its conversion into structured data (socially structured data) is the only way to provide web and systems with the necessary intelligence to exploit and manage digital world, where most of the life of individuals and companies will take place.
      {/p}

      {p}
      GNOSS promotes content social structuring by gathering on a single platform social networks power and social labeling, with the ability of the semantic web standards to structure data in a way that their meaning is exploitable by systems.
      {/p}

      Different reports, analyses and studies emphasize the decisive features and applications of semantic technologies in business (STE) that have appeared. Thus, for example, according to {a href="http://www.value-it.eu"}Value IT{/a}:

      {ul class="listadoAcerca"}
      {li}Interoperability{/li}
      {li}Search and link information{/li}
      {li}Collaboration (social){/li}
      {li}Business intelligence{/li}
      {li}Decission Making Support {/li}
      {li}Knowledge Management{/li}
      {li}Managing Big Data{/li}
      {li}Research and Development{/li}
      {/ul}

      Furthermore, different studies show the power of Social Media to increase some critical social functions for companies, such as learning, collaboration and knowledge management. Thus, e.g. Burson-Marsteller, Aberdeen Group, Gartner Group and Forrester have published reports that identify the following functions and applications :

      {ul class="listadoAcerca"}
      {li}Informal Learning{/li}
      {li}Accelerated Learning{/li}
      {li}Social Knowledge Management{/li}

      GNOSS public communities work with Linked Open Data. Open data is a philosophy and a practice that sees the point that certain data are freely available to everyone without restrictions of copyright, patents or other control mechanisms. In practice, the open data are Open Metadata, that is, concepts that describe the information to which they are linked. To be truly open data, data must be structured, that is, expressed with W3C semantic web standars (URIS/RDF) structured and open. In this case, they become Linked Data.

      All the contents (resources and wiki articles) in a GNOSS community must be

      a document in a sole category, we do have some good categorization
      criteria that you should know and try to follow.

      {/p}
      {p}GNOSS allows you to add the file easily from the application you are working with. To do this, you have to download and set up {a onclick="javascript:DesplegarPanel('divDescargaOffice')" style="cursor:pointer;" }the new GNOSS tool for {img src="@2@" }{/img} Office{/a}.

      {/p}

      Before sharing the file, you have to save it on your hard disk. GNOSS will search its location automatically.

      GNOSS University 2.0 {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}is a higher education approach that focuses on improving, enriching and accelerating university students learning process, through the possibilities offered by the tools of semantic and web 2.0 (social networks to learn and work){/span}. It is not the traditional e-learning, which, too often, has turned the Internet into an educational space to do the same things than in the classroom but, by other means. It has no longer to do with the discussion between classroom or online training, or between training through online property plataforms or plataforms based on more or less accurate {a href="http://www.moodle.com/"}Moodle{/a} customizations. Apart from Moodle, existing technology (social networks + semantic technologies) enables a magnifying and speeding effect in individual and community learning processes, enhancing any learning means (in the classroom or online).
      {/p}
      {p}
      The project University 2.0 has its starting point in September 2009. {a href="http://gnoss.com/perfil/riam"}Ricardo Alonso Maturana{/a}, founder and promoter of {a href="http://www.gnoss.com/"}www.gnoss.com{/a}, announces his {a href="http://practicasdigitales.unia.es/encuentro-universidad/memoria-del-encuentro-universidad-expandida.html#proyectos"}proposal Universidad 2.0 at Universidad Internacional de Andalucía (UNIA){/a}.

    <Resource tag="EN5MIN_INTRO">
      Ancient Greeks named ‘metis’ the practical intelligence applied to problems solving. The cunning of a general or the skill of a captain steering his ship during a storm are two particular instances of ‘metis’. ‘Metis’ is, certainly, acquired and developed within a specific relatioship: between father and child, a mentor and his or her pupil, or a teacher and his or her student. However, this relationship can occur between equals. ‘Metis’ accelerates also with further experiences, in other words, further battles or storms. This obviously implies:‘learning by doing’.
    </Resource>
    <Resource tag="EN5MIN_CONTENIDO">
      {p}
      Until now, applied inteligence and practice have been separate. Thought at University has seldom been a practice. The Internet can change the situation, it can {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}turn theoretical intelligence into practical{/span}. That is why we have designed {a href="http://universidad20.gnoss.com/"}GNOSS University 2.0{/a} participative architecture: to generate {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}deep network effects capable of accelerating learning social processes{/span}.
      {/p}
      {p}
      On the other hand, Digital Indentity architecture in {a href="http://gnoss.com/"}gnoss.com{/a} enables individuals to create and act with different avatars, in different contexts. These avatars relate to the specific interest that unites a given human group. Human identity is composed of different fragments unified by the self; gnoss.com allows to recreate this experience in the digital world.
      {/p}
      {p}
      Another strong point in GNOSS University 2.0 relates to {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}the publication of learning acts{/span}. When working in GNOSS University 2.0, students can subscribe not only to their professor's space but also, to the space of their classmates. {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}We have all learned, in the past, by asking and working with our equals, who prove to be excellent translators of codes and more or less formal lenguages with which we have been building knowledge over time. Now, this relationship can take place real time: I learn when I look at what all or some of my classmates look at, at the time they do it{/span}. This has two important consequences: firstly, we add {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}‘informal learning’{/span} capacity of accelerating collective training processes to a formal space for teaching-learning. And secondly, the system is capable of identifying most relevant people in a community, {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}the leaders{/span}, so to say. As we already mentioned, GNOSS University 2.0 has some tools to enable checking and monitoring everything other people do and learn from what they see in the Internet, from what they think, from what they write.
      {/p}
      {p}
      Of course, GNOSS University 2.0 comprises formal tools to allow professors to value the documents by community participants, but, as we previously said, networks are highly able to distinguish outstanding personalities and resources.
      {/p}
      {p}
      The possibilities of simultaneous sociability, of connecting and linking communities and people, of subscrition and asynchronous communication make particitative architecture in GNOSS University 2.0 a generator of network effects which tend to accelerate individuals and group learning processes.

The results of this experience are available at {a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/equipognoss#p/a/f/0/8sNCYT2_wTs"}gnoss.com channel on YouTube{/a}.
    </Resource>
    <Resource tag="PROYPILOTO_CONTENIDO">
      {p}
      According to Pilar Gago, one of the professors working with GNOSS University 2.0, the strong points of this expercience are:
      {ul class="listado"}
      {li}Revolution in the concept of continuous assessment{/li}
      {li}Greater efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process{/li}
      {/ul}
      {/p}{br /}
      {p}
      In the first point, {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}the concept of continuous assessment becomes real{/span} by seeing, assessing and evaluating transparently and real time searches, researches, descriptions, comments and students participation on gnoss.com. The student becomes an active agent and learning constructor researching on the Internet. He or she selects, uploads, summarize, tags, assesses and comments on information. Everything is open to the professor and to other students, thus accelerating the learning process.
      {/p}
      {p}
      Learning is more efficent because students, not only memorize, but they also become active agents, they research, acquire concepts, are more motivated and committed with the learning process. They use their language and can compare themselves to the rest of the students any time. {span style="color: rgb(227, 127, 79);"}Creating knowledge collectively and sharing it real-time implies team working{/span}, a student works for the rest and the rest for him or her.

    <Resource tag="DAFOONLINE_SUBTITULO">Share your opinons with professionals, experts and university students</Resource>
    <Resource tag="DAFOONLINE_INTRO">
      Social networks have proved to be more effective than individuals in two aspects:
      {ul class="listado"}
      {li}Tell useful from useless information for the net.{/li}
      {li}Building its members reputation, particularly, identifying those actual or probable leading members.{/li}

    <Resource tag="DAFOONLINE_CONTENIDO">
      {p}
      Such abilities can prove highly interesting in networks, especially, if student activity aggregate can identify a set of valuable resources or documents to deal with the subject or knowledge field involved thus, creating a general use resource set. This will be more and more necessary everytime the amount of digital resources increases. This fact will also gain importance in accordance with how much we ignore about the actual value of each resource. In such cases, professor's authority may not be enough, as it used to, to separate the wheat from the chaff and tell what is really useful and valuable.

      The Semantic Technology, the use of Linked Open Data and the creation of an ecosystem of learning communities in the context of Social Learning form the core of Didactalia.net. In this sense, the community aims to build an educational graph that gives meaning to distributed education and fragmented work of many teachers. This knowledge is managed on learning patterns and sequences that make sense for the educational community.
      {/p}
      {h4}Didactalia is Linked Data{/h4}
      {p}
      In Didactalia.net, we believe that the reusability of open educational resources through dynamic semantic publishing and the social learning communities are redefining the learning habits of students, parents and teachers. These practices are changing the way Education is delivered. Our answer is Didactalia.net, a model that tries to deliver a High-quality Education based on the possibilities of {a href="http://linkeddata.org/"}Linked Data{/a}. It deals with technologies and standards of the semantic web that enable to structure and connect all kind of contents–from Didactalia.net or other structured sources as LOD cloud-. Our solution reinforces and enlarges the knowledge management procedures with facet-based searches and generation of semantic contexts.
      {/p}
      {h4}Parents and schools{/h4}
      {p}
      Didactalia.net facilitates that parents can contract ready-to-use courses –as a collection of lessons- with online teachers and, on the other hand, schools can buy communities with personalized content through dynamic semantic publishing for their teachers.

      {a href="http://www.gnoss.com/login/redirect/registrar-profesor"}AULAS DIDACTALIA{/a} is the service for creating learning spaces (online classes and learning communities) of {a href="http://didactalia.net"}Didactalia.net{/a}. The service is designed to improve, enhance and accelerate student learning opportunities using tools of the semantic web and web 2.0. AULAS DIDACTALIA aims to work with social networking tools that are perfectly valid for teaching in K-12 or any other type of education.
      {/p}
      {p}
      The possibilities of simultaneous sociability, connection and link between communities and people through an architecture of participation make that DIDACTALIA accelerates the learning of individuals and groups. In turn, the framework of digital identity allows people to create and perform in different contexts with different avatars. These avatars respond to specific interests that collect that human group.

      {h4}Benefits{/h4}
      {p}
      AULAS DIDACTALIA aims to make learning acts more transparent. When students work in AULAS DIDACTALIA, they can subscribe not only their teacher, but any classmate. This has two important consequences: first, we add the ability of informal learning to accelerate the collective processes of a formal training for teaching and learning, and second, the system is able to identify the most relevant people to that community. We’re talking about leaders. In this sense, AULAS DIDACTALIA has tools that allow you to view and monitor others activity and learn from what they share.
      {/p}
      {p}
      AULAS DIDACTALIA permits the concept of continuous evaluation. A teacher can see and evaluate in a real-time and transparent way searches, investigations, descriptions, comments and student participation in class. The student becomes an active agent and builder of learning when he researches on the net, discriminating, uploading information, summarizing, labeling, valuing and commenting. All this process is transparent to the teacher and other students and it is a way to accelerate the learning process.
      {/p}
      {p}
      Furthermore, learning in AULAS DIDACTALIA is more effective because the students not only memorize: they act as active agents, investigating and internalizing concepts. They are more motivated and more engaged in learning, using their language and comparing it with other students. Creating and sharing knowledge in real time means working collectively.
      {/p}
      {h4}Premium services for families and schools{/h4}
      {p}
      AULAS DIDACTALIA offers premium services for families and teachers (schools). In the case of teachers, AULAS DIDACTALIA makes simplier any online community created by a teacher, can carry preloaded course lessons and materials to choose from Didactalia.net educational content. Thus, teachers can have a space of open educational resources associated with a particular course, and share them and work with students in an online class.
      {/p}
      {p}
      Meanwhile, families can apply for a private space that includes a package of lessons on the subject and level it they consider appropriate. The service includes an online tutor for any questions.

      As a teacher that works in {a href="http://didactalia.net"}Didactalia.net{/a}, you can get these benefits:
      {/p}
      {ul class="listadoAcerca"}
      {li}{strong}Get your students to work in teams{/strong}
      {p}
      The process of learning is more effective because students do not just memorize, but act, investigate and internalize concepts. The result is that they are more motivated and more committed to their own learning. This happens because you use your language, but also because it can be compared with other students. Creating and sharing knowledge is working in a team: a student working for the collective and the collective for the student.
      {/p}
      {/li}
      {li}{strong}Promote opinion activities{/strong}
      {p}
      The social tools facilitate deeper learning and because they investigate further they do in a context of greater clearness. This means more responsibility on the sought, written,analyzed and confronted with the view of the collective.
      {/p}
      {/li}
      {li}{strong}Help your students to give visibility and exhibit their work{/strong}
      {p}
      The student takes the classes in an online space in which meaningfully, mixes and matches various resources on the Web. This creates an element of interest for its informative nature, as an aggregation of diverse and dispersed sources. {a href="@1@"}AULAS DIDACTALIA{/a} promotes transparency and traceability of learning events, allowing its publication and contributing to reuse by others. This has two important consequences: first, we add the ability of informal learning to accelerate the collective processes of a formal training for teaching and learning, and second, the system is able to identify and show most relevant people to each community. This favors the initiative and competition.
      {/p}
      {/li}
      {li}{strong}Implement a system of open and transparent evaluation{/strong}
      {p}
      AULAS DIDACTALIA makes real the concept of continuous evaluation: the teacher can view investigations, descriptions, comments and participation of a student in real-time. The teacher also has a specific tool, the teacher notebook, with social metrics of their students.
